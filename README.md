This Privacy Policy describes how our mobile application collects, uses, and safeguards the information provided by users. By using our mobile application, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Our mobile application collects and uses only the following information from users:

1. **User-Provided Files**: Our application allows users to send and upload files to the app for processing or storage. These files may contain personal information or sensitive data. We collect and store these files solely for the purpose of providing the requested services to the user.

2. **Private Messages**: Our application may provide a messaging system for users to communicate with the system or other users. Any private messages sent through the app are stored temporarily for delivery purposes and are not used for any other purposes.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We understand the importance of maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of user data. We do not share, sell, or disclose any user-provided files or private messages with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

1. **With User Consent**: We may share user-provided files or private messages with third parties if the user has given explicit consent for such sharing.

2. **For Legal Compliance**: We may share user-provided files or private messages when required to do so by law, or to comply with a valid legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.

## Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect user-provided files and private messages from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of user data.

## Retention of User Data

We retain user-provided files and private messages for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which they were collected or as required by law. Once the files or messages are no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize them.

## Children's Privacy

Our mobile application is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will promptly delete it from our systems.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the revised version will be effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
